# Weather-Based Spotify Song Recommendation Website

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a website that integrates with Spotify to provide song recommendations based on the user's local weather conditions. The application will allow users to log in with their Spotify account, retrieve their liked songs, and suggest music that matches the current weather forecast.

## Roadmap

### 1. Project Planning and Setup
- **Define Requirements**: Outline features such as user authentication, weather data retrieval, and song recommendations.
- **Tech Stack Selection**: Use Python for backend development (Flask/Django) and HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend.
- **Environment Setup**: Set up a development environment with necessary tools and libraries.

### 2. Spotify Integration
- **Spotify Developer Account**: Create an account and set up a new application to obtain client ID and secret.
- **User Authentication**: Implement OAuth2 for Spotify login.
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch user data like liked songs and playlists using the Spotify API.

### 3. Weather Data Integration
- **Weather API Selection**: Choose a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and obtain an API key.
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch current weather and forecast data based on user location.

### 4. Backend Development
- **Data Processing**: Develop logic to analyze weather data and match it with songs.
- **Recommendation Algorithm**: Create an algorithm to suggest songs based on weather and user preferences.

### 5. Frontend Development
- **UI/UX Design**: Design a user-friendly interface for displaying weather and song recommendations.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the website is responsive across devices.

### 6. Integration and Testing
- **API Integration**: Connect backend with frontend for smooth data flow.
- **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure all features work as expected.

### 7. Deployment
- **Hosting**: Choose a platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS) to deploy the application.
- **Domain Setup**: Register a domain and configure it for your application.

### 8. Maintenance and Updates
- **Monitor Performance**: Regularly check application performance and reliability.
- **User Feedback**: Gather feedback to improve and add new features.

## Additional Considerations
- **Privacy and Security**: Ensure secure handling of user data, especially during authentication.
- **Scalability**: Design the application to efficiently handle an increasing number of users.
